# Snake Recognition App

## Overview

**Snake Recognition App** is designed to identify and provide information about various snake species using image recognition technologies. Leveraging Google Colab, ImageAI, PyTorch, Flask, Pandas, and the ChatGPT API, this project trains a custom image detection model to recognize 150 different snake species. The application offers detailed information on each snake, including its name, country of origin, scientific name, venomous status, and a brief description generated by ChatGPT. The app features a simple web interface built with Flask, HTML, and Tailwind CSS.
